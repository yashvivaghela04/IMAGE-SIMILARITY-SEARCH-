# IMAGE-SIMILARITY-SEARCH using pretrained models
This project compares four different pretrained deep learning models—ResNet50, ViT, CLIP, and DeiT—to find the top 10 most similar images to a given input image. Using feature embeddings and FAISS for efficient similarity search, the goal is to evaluate how each model performs in terms of speed, accuracy, and suitability for image similarity tasks.
