# IMAGE-SIMILARITY-SEARCH-
This project implements an advanced image similarity search system using Vision Transformer (ViT) for feature extraction and FAISS for efficient similarity indexing. By leveraging deep learning and robust search techniques, the system identifies and retrieves visually similar images from a dataset, providing accurate and scalable results.
